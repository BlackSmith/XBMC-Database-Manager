Since the current codebase is primarily for testing purposes it isn't made to fit every setup.

To get this up and running without config tweaking do as follows:

1: Install packages: apache2, php5, php5-sqlite, php5-mysql, sqlite3

2: Put all files in a folder outside of your www-root

3: Create a vhost with the following content:
	<VirtualHost <hostname/ip/*>:80>
	    ServerName <server name here>
	    ServerAlias <alias here>
	    DocumentRoot /path/to/the/folder/www-root

	    <Directory /path/to/the/folder/www-root>
	        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	        AllowOverride All
	        allow from all
	    </Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

4: Edit the data/xbmcdm.db sqlite database, set the correct settings in dbconnection table
	Will be fixed in the future so it can be set via settings page.
	
5: Restart apache
